# VBD-MODE
Interview Exercises

This repository contains my solution to the VBD-MODE interview exercise.  
The task is to numerically solve a 3-dimensional ODE system using the 4th-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method and then visualize the results.

The implementation is written in Python and follows the specification as requested.
